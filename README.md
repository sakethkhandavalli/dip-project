To run on the algorithm on a single image :

`HRM_image = dcs(LRM_image,HRP_image)`

To run on the algorithm on the mini Landsat dataset run the test program by using :

`test`

To the scores of different evaluation metrices on an image use the `get_score` function:
`get_score(LRM_image,HRP_image)`
